However, where the device is used for continu- ous control to maintain functional safety, for example when the use of a stop switch solely prevents an elevator controller from operating in automatic operation, the SIL shall represent the requirement for a device considered operating in the high demand mode and the dangerous failure rate of the device (see CEI IEC 61508-1, Table 3 and definition). (b) For the purposes of this Standard, SIL refers to SIL rating of a E/E/PES to the applicable requirements of CEI IEC 61508-2 and CEI IEC 61508-3. (c) The SIL values specified in Table 2.26.4.3.2 are based on a proof-test frequency of no more than half the rate of demand on the safety function. The inspection frequencies provided in Nonmandatory Appendix N serve as a reference to this proof-test interval and are addressed in the Maintenance Control Program. See requirement 8.6.1.4.1(a). (d) It is possible to use several lower safety integrity level systems to satisfy the need for a higher safety integrity level function provided that the implementation is certified. (e) The summary of functions described in the \u201cSafety Function\u201d column are for reference only. The referenced Code item in the \u201cRequire- ment\u201d column must be used to determine the safety function of the item in the \u201cDevice Name\u201d column. NOTES: (1) A device rated SIL 4 or less cannot fulfill this function. (2) For the application of a SIL 3 ELECTRICAL/ELECTRONIC/PROGRAMMABLE ELECTRONIC SYSTEMS device for freights and cars with swing hoistway doors, an independent monitoring of the closed car door gate position by the elevator control is required to prevent the car from moving if the car/gate door is open. 119 Copyright        2013 by the American Society of Mechanical Engineers.

Building security systems that limit ser- vice to these floors shall be overridden. Any landing call within the contiguous block of floors shall call an elevator(s) to that landing. Landing calls entered at the floor with an active alarm shall be given higher priority than the calls at the floors above and below it. If a subsequent active alarm is received from a different floor, the evacuation priority shall be assigned in the sequence received. Once passengers have entered an elevator, it shall proceed only towards the elevator dis- charge level. When total building evacuation is in effect and no calls are entered at an affected floor, priority shall be based on distance from the elevator discharge level, with the furthest floor served getting highest priority. 2.27.11.6.4 Car calls for all floors, except for the elevator discharge level, shall be canceled and disabled.

If the car is in motion away from the floors being evacuated, it shall stop at or before the next available floor, without opening the doors, reverse direction, and move to a floor that is being evacuated. 2.27.11.6.6 Cars that are occupied when Occupant Evacuation Operation is actuated shall pro- ceed without delay to the elevator discharge level. If a reversal of travel direction is needed, it shall be done at or before the next available floor without opening the doors. After opening and closing the doors at the eleva- tor discharge level, they shall proceed without delay to a floor that is being evacuated and park with their doors closed until a landing call is registered. 2.27.11.6.7 When a car answers a landing call at a floor being evacuated, a car call for the elevator discharge level shall be automatically registered. The system shall accept a new landing call as soon as the doors have opened to permit loading at that floor, or sooner. If a new landing call is registered at this floor, it shall be assigned to another car, and not canceled until that car arrives. Actuation of the landing call device shall not prevent a loaded car from closing its doors and leaving the floor. 2.27.11.6.8 While passengers are entering the car at a floor being evacuated, when the load reaches no greater than 80% of car capacity, the door reopening device(s) shall be disabled and the doors shall initiate closing at reduced kinetic energy in accordance with 2.13.4.2.1(c).

By reason of their limited use and the types of construction of the mines served, compliance with Part 2 is modified as follows (see also 1.3): (a)  Substitute \u201cTitle 30 Code of Federal Regulations\u201d or \u201cState Mine Laws\u201d (if applicable) for \u201cbuilding code.\u201d (b)  Substitute \u201cmine\u201d for \u201cbuilding.\u201d (c)  Requirements modified in 5.9. NOTES (5.9): (1) Title 30 Code of Federal Regulations provides for certain addi- tional and more stringent requirements. Where applicable, Title 30 requirements have been addressed in this Section. (2) See also Part 8 for additional requirements that apply to  mine elevators. Copyright        2013 by the American Society of Mechanical Engineers.

The following requirements apply to the accept- ance tests of Types A, B, and C safeties (Item 2.29): (a)  Car safeties shall be tested with rated load in the car. In making the test of car safeties, the load shall be 379 centered on each quarter of the platform symmetrically with respect to the centerlines of the platform. Counter- weight safeties, where provided, shall be tested with no load in the car. (b)  The car speed at which the governor trips shall be determined by means of a tachometer or other device designed to measure car speed and, if necessary, the governor shall be replaced or adjusted to conform to 2.18.2. (c)  If adjustments to the tripping speed are made, the governor shall be sealed immediately following the test. Governors shall be sealed, as required by 2.18.3. (d)  The operation of the governor overspeed and the car safety-mechanism switch shall be tested to deter- mine conformance with 2.18.4 and 2.17.7. (e)  After the safety has stopped the car, the level of the car platform shall be checked to determine confor- mance with 2.17.9.2. (f)  A metal tag with the rule number, test date, and name of the person/firm performing the test shall be attached to the releasing carrier or where the governor rope attaches to the safety. (2)  Type A Governor-Operated Safeties (a)  Type A governor-operated safeties shall be tested by operating the car at its rated speed in the down direction and manually tripping the governor jaws. A test shall also be made of the inertia application of the safety to determine conformance with 2.17.8.1, by attaching the proper weight to the return run of the governor rope. The manufacturer shall inform the per- son making the test of the weight necessary to be added to the governor rope when making the inertia applica- tion test. This weight shall be that necessary to reproduce inertia operation of the safety at not more than   9 \u2044 10  grav- ity. The inertia application test shall be made with the car stationary, and the weight, when released, shall move the safety parts into contact with the rails. See Nonmandatory Appendix M, Fig. M-1, for location of weight to be attached to the governor rope when making the inertia test. Inertia application of the safety on the Type A auxiliary safety plank of Type C safeties is not required. (b)  If means other than inertia application of the safety is provided, such means shall be tested in an appropriate manner to ensure that the safety will apply without appreciable delay under free-fall condition and that the safety application is independent of the location of the break in the hoisting ropes. (3) Type A Safeties Without Governors.  Type A safe- ties without governors that are operated only as a result of the breaking or slackening of the suspension ropes shall be tested by obtaining the necessary slack rope to cause it to function. (4)  Types B and C Safeties (a)  Types B and C safeties shall be subjected to an overspeed test, with the suspension ropes attached, Copyright        2013 by the American Society of Mechanical Engineers.

Safeties of elevators equipped with AC driving- machine motors, where the car with its rated load does not cause sufficient overspeed when the machine brake is released to trip the governor jaws, shall be tested by operating the car at its rated speed in the down direction and tripping governor jaws by hand; see 8.10.2.2.2(hh) for test of governor tripping speed. (b)  The overspeed switch on the governor shall be inoperative during the overspeed test. In order to ensure that the safety will retard the car with the mini- mum assistance from the elevator driving machine and minimize the development of slack rope and fallback of the counterweight, the switch on the car operated by the car safety mechanism shall, for the duration of the test, be temporarily adjusted to open as close as possible to the position at which the car safety mechanism is in the fully applied position. (c)  The stopping distances for Type B safeties shall conform to 2.17.3, and shall be determined by mea- suring the length of the marks made by the safety jaws or wedges on both sides of each car guide rail, deducting the length of the safety jaw or wedge used, and taking the average of the four readings. (d)  For Type B safeties, the movement of the gov- ernor rope to operate the safety mechanism shall be tested to determine conformance with 2.17.11. (e)  For Type C safeties, the stopping distance shall be equal to the stroke of the buffer located between the lower member of the car frame and the auxiliary safety plank, and shall conform to 2.17.8.2. After the safety has stopped the car, the level of the auxiliary safety plank shall be checked to determine conformance with 2.17.8.2.6. (f)  For Type C safeties, the buffer compression switch and oil level devices shall be tested to determine conformance with 2.17.8.2.7 and 2.17.8.2.8. (jj)  Ascending Car Overspeed, and Unintended Car Motion Protection (1) Ascending Car Overspeed Protection.

It is recommended that a risk analysis, using the methodology of ISO/TS 14798, be utilized to establish the intervals of inspections and tests for components and systems of the equipment. Where a risk analysis is not performed, the intervals specified in Table N1 are recommended for periodic tests (see 8.6) and periodic inspections (see 8.11). 450 Copyright        2013 by the American Society of Mechanical Engineers.

It is intended to provide information as to where monitoring is or is not practical based on current technology. It is not intended to be all-inclusive or limit the use of monitoring to the identified items. Monitoring function can be accomplished in two ways. (a) Overlay Monitoring.  Overlay monitoring is accom- plished by adding a stand-alone monitoring system to an existing elevator installation. This monitoring system would connect to the elevator control system to monitor various signal points and report their status. Using its internal processing the stand-alone monitoring system could determine normal signal status and report any monitored abnormal behavior. (b) Integral Monitoring.  Integral monitoring is built into the elevator control system. This allows better access to the functions of the elevator control system. This type of monitoring can report abnormal operation of a more inclusive variety than is practical with the overlay moni- toring system.

The application of monitoring to elevator/escalator inspection is a practical approach to supplementing on- site inspections. All elevator/escalator devices that have an electrical contact can usually be monitored and the operation of the contact can be transmitted to a remote site for storage or viewing. Adding devices that will locally monitor the function and transmit the results to a remote site may also monitor other functions of the elevator/escalator. Such a device to monitor another function could be a tachometer to monitor the speed of the elevator. This could be set to trigger an alert or message if the device detected an abnormal condition. The data collected by the monitoring system can be reported to a central data collection and storage site. This communications link can be via the in-car phone or other device. If the in-car phone is used, the monitor reporting modem must be secondary in priority to the communications requirements in 2.27.1.

Similarly, overall system effectiveness will be maximized if the design incorporates the most up-to-date research on human behavior during emergency evacuation. Designers should specify system components which reflect the latest research on human factors issues, including the following: (a)  Floor Wardens (1)  will carry out the responsibilities correctly (b)  Occupant Training (1)  will attend initial training sessions (2)  will attend ongoing training (c)  Occupants and Lobby Signage/Voice Notification (SVN) (1)  will take the time to observe the SVN (2)  will understand the SVN symbols/language (3)  will follow the SVN instructions (4)  the design of and training on the two-way communication system will ensure correct use (5)  will have a workable sense of acceptable wait times in the elevator lobby (6)  will make the correct decision regarding using elevators or the stairs (7)  if having decided to leave the elevator lobby, will go to the stairway in an orderly manner (d)  Occupants and Elevators (1)  The design of and training on the two-way communication system will ensure correct use. (e)  Occupants \u2014 General stairs (1)  will accurately gauge their ability to take the (2)  will provide correct assistance to others who cannot use the stairs (3)  visitors will follow the lead of trained occupants V-1.1 Occupant Evacuation Operation. Occupant Evacuation Operation has been designed with the assumption that the following building provisions are in place. If Occupant Evacuation Operation is provided in a building that does not meet these, a hazard analysis (e.g., ISO 14798) should be performed. (a)  The building is a high rise business occupancy (office building) and at the time of permitting conforms 479 to the latest editions of the building code (IBC, NFPA 5000, or NBCC) and ASME A17.1/CSA B44. (b)  The automatic sprinkler system required by the building code is installed in accordance with NFPA 13 except that sprinklers in elevator machine rooms and hoistways are prohibited. (c)  An emergency voice/alarm communications sys- tem meeting the requirements of NFPA 72 is provided to inform occupants on each floor of the current situation and actions to take in an emergency. The announcements should include information about whether or not the elevators are available. (d)  Interior exit stairwell doors automatically unlock, allowing both exit and re-entry, upon any alarm in accor- dance with the options permitted by the building code. (e)  The elevator lobby at each floor, with the exception of the elevator discharge level, is enclosed and separated from the remainder of the floor by a smoke barrier. The elevator lobby enclosure door has a   3 \u2044 4 -hr fire rating and a vision panel, and closes automatically upon initiation of the building fire alarm system. The lobby is large enough to accommodate 25% of the floor population at 3 ft 2   per person and a minimum of one wheelchair space per 50 occupants with each space minimum 760 mm  \ufffd  1 220 mm (30 in.  \ufffd  48 in.). There is direct access from each elevator lobby to an enclosed exit stair. That exit stair enclosure is provided with a second door at each floor that provides access to the floor without requiring travel through the elevator lobby. (f)  The elevator lobbies, at all floors except the eleva- tor discharge level, and hoistways are pressurized together to keep them free of smoke without introducing a pressure differential across the hoistway doors. Active smoke control systems that keep smoke away from the elevators and elevator lobbies are an acceptable alterna- tive. The adjacent exit stair enclosure is separately pressurized. (g)  The building is designed to control the flow of water that accumulates on the floor as a result of sprin- kler operation outside the elevator lobby and hoistway. This water is directed to drains or other means, so it does not enter an elevator hoistway from any side. (h)  The building has a fire safety and evacuation plan, approved by the authority having jurisdiction, specifi- cally including procedures for evacuation using stairs and elevators, the roles of fire wardens, a routine training (13) Copyright        2013 by the American Society of Mechanical Engineers. No reproduction may be made of this material without written consent of ASME. c ASME A17.1-2013/CSA B44-13 program and drills for occupants. Training includes the message that elevators should not be used for evacuation in buildings without Occupant Evacuation Operation. The fire safety plan includes the requirement that eleva- tor lobbies and machine rooms be maintained to mini- mize fire loads. (i)  The elevators designated for Occupant Evacuation Operation, machine room air conditioning, variable message sign(s), voice notification, fire alarm, two-way communication, and pressurization systems are all sup- plied with standby or emergency power with sufficient 480 capacity to operate these elevators and these associated systems simultaneously. The standby or emergency power system is minimum Type 60, Class 2, Level 1 in accordance with NFPA 110. The normal power feeders and backup power feeders are separated from each other, and each contained in its own 2-hr fire resistance rated enclosure until they reach the elevator machine room. (j)  A two-way voice communications system is installed, allowing communications between the fire command center and each elevator lobby.

The Preface to the Code explains the procedure for requesting interpretations. This booklet includes the interpretations which were issued by the A17 Committee from July 2009 through June 2012. Subsequent interpretations will be included with each new edition of the Code. APPLICABILITY OF INTERPRETATIONS Each interpretation applies to the edition and supple- ments listed for that inquiry. Many of the Rules on which the interpretations have been made have been revised in later editions or supplements. Where such revisions have been made, the interpretations may no longer be applicable to the revised Rule. ASME procedures provide for reconsideration of these interpretations when or if additional information is available which might affect any interpretation. Further, persons aggrieved by any interpretation may appeal to the cognizant ASME committee or subcommittee. ASME does not \u201capprove,\u201d \u201ccertify,\u201c \u201drate,\u201c or \u201cendorse\u201d any item, construction, proprietary device, or activity. INTERPRETATIONS INDEX A subject index of interpretations is included in this booklet on pages 81 through 98. This index includes all interpretations that have been issued on the A17.1 Code since 1972. The interpretations are listed in order by the subjects (Part, Section, Rule, etc.). The \u201dEdition\u201d refers to the edition or addenda of the Code on which the interpreta- tion was rendered, e.g., \u201c85a\u201d refers to A17.1a\u20131985. The \u201cBk. No.\u201d refers to the interpretations booklet number in which the interpretation was published. The interpretations that were issued from 1972 through 1979 were published in a separate book which may be pur- chased from ASME. Subsequent interpretations were issued in separate booklets which have accompanied each edition and supplement of the A17.1 Code since 1981. These are listed below.

However, there were requirements in Rule 2410.6 (seismic) for safety valves. This included requiring that the safety valve stop and hold the car with rated load. ASME A17.1\u20132000/CSA B44-00 added requirements for overspeed valves in 3.19.4.7. Also, 8.4.11.2 (seismic) requires an overspeed valve to conform to 3.19.4.7. Requirement 3.19.4.7 contains requirements for the maximum deceleration rates permitted by an overspeed valve, but does not explicitly require that it stop and hold the elevator. Requirement 3.19.4.7 also requires the engineering tests specified in 8.3.9, which includes a seat leakage test and a closing cycle endurance test. Question (1): (a)  Is it required that an overspeed valve stop and hold the car with rated load? (b)  Is it permissible for the car to lower into the pit onto the buffers within the deceleration rates permitted by 3.19.4.7? Answer (1): (a)  Yes; however, after the initial stop, slight movement may occur due to cooling of the hydraulic fluid and minor leakage of the hydraulic seals. (b)  Yes. Question (2): Is it permissible for an overspeed valve to reset after it trips by (a)  running upward automatically to make a correction run? (b)  leveling upward automatically? Answer (2): This is not addressed in the Code. However, in ASME A17.1\u20132007/CSA B44-07, 8.10.3.2.5(o) and 8.11.3.4.5 require manufacturers\u2019 procedures to be available. A17 Standards Committee Approval: September 16, 2009 Inquiry: 08-36 Subject: Rule 111.12, Rule 111.5, and Requirement 2.12.5 Edition: ASME A17.1-1996, ASME 17.1a-1997, and ASME A17.1\u20132000/CSA B44-00, respectively Background: There are conflicting interpretations in the field based on Inquiries 00-30, 06-02, 06-11, and 04-43 regarding whether a door restrictor that relies on power to either restrict the car door when the car is outside the unlocking zone and/or unrestrict the doors when the car is inside the unlocking zone is Code compliant if it is possible that the door restrictor cannot function if normal power is unavailable and the battery backup is dead. Question: Is a door restrictor that relies on power to either restrict the car door when the car is outside the unlocking zone and/or unrestrict the doors when the car is inside the unlocking zone Code compliant if it is possible that the door restrictor cannot function if normal power is unavailable and the battery backup is dead? Answer: A device which was permitted to become nonfunctional would violate the Code [see Inquiry 00-30 and Inquiry 04-43, Question (4)]. A device requiring maintenance to retain functionality would not violate the Code [see Inquiry 04-43, Question (5)]. There is no conflict among the answers in Inquiries 00-30, 04-43, 06-02, and 06-11.

Answer (1): No. A running platform with temporary run buttons would not comply with Section 5.10 and could not be used as an elevator used for construction. The term \u201cconstruction hoist\u201d is not an ASME A17.1 defined term. Question (2): Since elevator components have been designed for elevators and the design guidelines are governed by ASME A17.1, could not the elevator components, once they have been started to be installed in a hoistway and machine room where they will become a functioning elevator, be defined as \u201can elevator under construction\u201d? Answer (2): ASME A17.1 does not define an \u201celevator under construction.\u201d Question (3): Can this partially installed elevator be used to carry construction material not affiliated with the actual elevator installation, on a construction site as per ASME A17.1, Section 5.10? Answer (3): Only an elevator in compliance with Section 5.10 is permitted \u201cto provide transporta- tion for construction personnel, tools, and materials only.\u201d There is no qualification or limitation on the type of materials. Question (4): May an elevator under construction be used to carry equipment and personnel to assist a project without all the requirements of ASME A17.1, Section 5.10 being met? Answer (4): No. Elevators used for construction are required to comply with all the requirements of Section 5.10. Question (5): When can elevator components be defined as an elevator? Answer (5): See Section 1.3 of ASME A17.1 for definitions of the various types of elevators. Elevator components can be only defined as being an elevator when the installation complies with the requirements of ASME A17.1.

Requirement 7.1.11 references Section 2.11, Protection of Hoistway Entrances. Requirement 2.11.4.2 seems to apply; we have an electric dumbwaiter with automatic operation. Question: Is the distance 100 mm (4 in.), 19 mm (0.75 in.), or some other distance? Answer: This issue is not addressed by the Code. A17 Standards Committee Approval: September 16, 2009 Inquiry: 09-38 Subject: Requirements 8.11.3.2.1 and 8.11.3.2.2; and Item 2.31.2, Regarding Category 1 Pressure Tests Edition: ASME A17.1\u20132007/CSA B44-07 and ASME A17.2\u20132007 Background: The hydraulic elevator system has either a single Up valve or a single unit valve. As is the usual method, the Up valve or Up section of the unit valve is used to bypass the full output of the pump for pressure relief (among other things). Realize that in up leveling, the Up valve or Up section of the unit valve is partially open, causing part of the pump output to bypass to the tank, and part to run the elevator up. If the elevator is then run up such that the plunger stop contacts the inside of the top of the cylinder, the pressure relief should cause the Up valve or Up section of the unit valve to open fully, thus bypassing the full output of the pump. Question (1): Is it permitted to test the pressure relief setting and system pressure by running the elevator onto the stop ring at Up leveling speed and reading the pressure gauge? Answer (1): No. See ASME A17.2, Item 2.31.2.2 for a recommended procedure. Question (2): Is it permitted to test the flexible hose and fittings, if present, by keeping the motor running for the specified period of time? Answer (2): Yes, provided the relief valve test is conducted in accordance with 8.11.3.2.1. Note that a minimum of 30 sec is required by 8.11.3.2.4.

That has caused the elevator to fall like a rock, and essentially destroy the car frame and cab. The entire hydraulic system would be equally tested if the car was tied down or blocked down fairly close to the bottom of travel. Without a fall of five (5) or more floors, the cylinder would fail the test, but the car frame and car would not be destroyed. Question: Is it permitted to perform the referenced tests with the elevator car frame tied down or blocked down so that a cylinder that has a catastrophic failure does not in turn wreck the car? Answer: No. Requirements 3.18.3.4 and 8.6.5.8 of ASME A17.1\u20132007/CSA B44-07 require all hydraulic cylinders installed below ground to be equipped with a safety bulkhead or equipped with a car safety or plunger gripper. The condition described should not occur.

A17 Standards Committee Approval: September 16, 2009 Inquiry: 09-41 Subject: Requirement 2.27.3.4(d) Edition: ASME A17.1 2007/CSA B44-07 Background: An elevator is at a landing on Phase II Emergency In-Car Operation with the key in the \u201cON\u201d position. Power to the elevator is lost and upon a power recovery the car and hoistway doors are partially open (not fully open or closed). Question: Upon power recovery and before the \u201cDOOR OPEN\u201d or \u201cDOOR CLOSE\u201d button is used to fully open or close the doors, does the Code prohibit any movement of the doors due to external forces such as the door closer required under 2.11.3.1 or windage? Answer: No. Only powered movement is prohibited. A17 Standards Committee Approval: January 13, 2010 15 Copyright        2013 by the American Society of Mechanical Engineers.

The definition for \u201coperation, automatic\u201d is followed by several other definitions, (starting with \u201coperation, group automatic\u201d and ending with \u201coperation, single automatic\u201d) that are all set back one additional indent from the definition for \u201coperation, automatic.\u201d A similar format is used for the definitions for \u201ccontrol, motion.\u201d Question (1): An operation controller automatically starts an elevator by entering (registering) floor destinations that are identified with landings from the momentary actuation of operating devices located at each landing and causes the elevator to be dispatched to the landing at which the floor destinations were entered. The elevator automatically opens its doors at the landing to receive passengers who are then taken to the registered destination landing(s) and automatically stops the elevator to allow passengers to exit the car. There may be no operating devices identified with landings in the car for passengers to enter destinations, only the aforementioned devices at landings are used for this purpose. Does the above operation fall under the definition of \u201coperation, automatic\u201d? Answer (1): Yes. Question (2): Is the definition for \u201coperation, automatic\u201d a type of operation control? Answer (2): Yes. Question (3): Are all definitions indented under \u201coperation, automatic\u201d such as \u201coperation, group automatic\u201d and \u201coperation, single automatic\u201d considered to be examples of the same type of operation control, i.e., automatic operation? Answer (3): Yes. Question (4): If the answer to Question (3) is no, what is the purpose of the indented format for these definitions? Answer (4): See the answer to Question (3). Question (5): If the answer to Question (3) is yes, are the indented definitions under \u201coperation, automatic\u201d examples of various forms of this type of operation control and that other examples may exist so long as they fit the definition of \u201coperation, automatic\u201d? Answer (5): Yes. Question (6): Can the answers to Questions (3), (4), and (5), in principle, be applied to the definitions for \u201ccontrol, motion\u201d when trying to determine types of motion controls? Answer (6): The question is too broad to be provided with a response in principle.

The requirement could be read that the gasketing material is permitted to be applied on any manufactured entrance assembly after testing on one manufactured entrance assembly with an existing Label/Listing, or it could be read that each Label/Listed entrance assembly must be tested with a gasketing material applied on each manufactured type of entrance. The concern is some mounting schemes for gasketing devices use a mechanical method of mounting a metal extrusion by drilling and fastening the hoistway door or entrance frame about its perimeter approximately every 150 mm (6 in.) with screws, perhaps affecting the performance of the entrance assembly during a fire. Since this mechanically changes the doors or frames, a new UL 10B, NFPA 252, or CAN4-S104 test should be required with the gasketing devices applied for each manufactured (brand) entrance assembly design. In most all other cases where an entrance assembly is mechanically altered, the Label/Listing is voided. In order to assure continued protection throughout the life cycle of the entrance assembly, the gasketing and/or entrance assembly manufacturer should provide evidence of compliance for all entrance assemblies using similar mechanical mounting methods and then tested to UL 10B, NFPA 252, or CAN4-S104. This may be difficult in the case of existing entrance assemblies not presently in manufacture, and therefore gasketing devices relying on mechanical fastenings should not be allowed on existing entrance assemblies which would jeopardize the existing Label/Listing. Question: Does 2.11.19.1 require UL 10B, NFPA 252, or CAN4-S104 testing, listing, and labeling for each type and brand of listed entrance that gasketing will be applied to? Answer: No. The Code does not address the types and brands of entrances with which to test the gasketing. The referenced standards address the specific requirements and testing methods that a certifying organization would use to evaluate the gasketing for labeling. Please note that the gasketing material or the attachment method may affect the listing and labeling of entrance assembly. A17 Standards Committee Approval: May 6, 2010 Inquiry: 10-370 Subject: Requirements 2.27.2.4.3 and 2.27.2.4.6 Edition: ASME A17.1-2007/CSA B44-07 through ASME A17.11\u20132008/CSA B44a-08 Background: Requirement 2.27.2.4.3 calls for a means \u201cto indicate that the elevator is at the designated level with the doors in the normally open position\u201d when the selector switch(es) is not located at the designated level in view of all elevator entrances and after the elevator has returned to the designated level as required by 2.27.2.4.4(a). Also, 2.27.2.4.4 indicates that the means to return the elevator, one at a time to the designated level, be automatic with certain stated provisions. Further, 2.27.2.4.5 permits automatic selection of the elevator to remain in service while 2.27.4.6 calls for a visual means (a different indicator to the 2.27.2.4.3 indicator) to indicate the selected elevator(s). In a scenario where the 2.27.2.4.3 \u201cRecalled\u201d indicator is required, the selector switch is in the \u201cAUTO\u201d position, all elevators have successfully recalled to the designated level, all elevators are parked with the power-operated doors in the normally open position, and one elevator is automatically selected to remain in operation. 28 Copyright        2013 by the American Society of Mechanical Engineers.

Answer (1): No. Question (2): Are the power-operated doors on the selected elevator permitted to close at the time the elevator is automatic selected? Answer (2): Yes. Question (3): If the answer to both Question (1) and (2) is no, when, after completion of automatic selection, are the power-operated doors permitted to close on the automatically selected elevator? Answer (3): See answers to Questions (1) and (2). Question (4): In the sequence where the selected elevator closes the power-operated doors and then leaves the designated level, must the 2.27.2.4.3 \u201cRecalled\u201d indicating means turn \u201cOFF\u201d (a)  when the power-operated doors move away from the normally open position; or (b)  when the elevator leaves the designated level? Answer (4): (a)  Yes. (b)  The indicating means is already off per Answer (a). Question (5): In the sequence where the selected elevator moves away from the designated level, then returns to the designated level, and opens the power-operated doors, must the 2.27.2.4.3 \u201cRecalled\u201d indicating means turn \u201cON\u201d (a)  when the elevator arrives at the designated level and before the power-operated doors open; or (b)  when the power-operated doors reach the normally open position with the elevator at the designated level? Answer (5): (a)  No. (b)  Yes. Question (6): When the selector switch(es) is in the \u201cAUTO\u201d position, and the elevator that is to remain in operation has successfully recalled to the designated level and is automatically selected, is the 2.27.2.4.6 \u201cSelected\u201d indicating means required to turn \u201cON\u201d for the selected elevator? Answer (6): Yes. Question (7): Is the 2.27.2.4.6 \u201cSelected\u201d indicator required to turn \u201cON\u201d for the selected elevator when that elevator is automatically selected, or is this indication just for manual selection? Answer (7): It must operate on both \u201cAUTO\u201d and \u201cMANUAL.\u201d A17 Standards Committee Approval: May 6, 2010 29 Copyright        2013 by the American Society of Mechanical Engineers.

In 2.27.3.3.4, the mode change is from \u201cON\u201d to \u201cOFF\u201d with the door(s) in the closed position. In 2.27.3.4, the Phase II Fire Service mode to be established appears to be based on the position of the \u201cFIRE OPERATION\u201d switch upon restoration of power and without regards to the position of the door(s). In 2.27.3.3.3(a) and (b), the Phase II Fire Service mode change from \u201cON\u201d to \u201cOFF\u201d first takes place with the car door(s) in the normally open position. However, while the door(s) is closing and before the door(s) get fully closed, if the \u201cFIRE OPERATION\u201d switch is moved to the \u201cON\u201d or \u201cHOLD\u201d position prior to completion of door closing, then the mode change is from \u201cOFF\u201d back to \u201cON\u201d or to \u201cHOLD\u201d with the door(s) NOT in the normally open position as required in 2.27.3.3 (second paragraph). NOTE: Requirement 2.27.3.4(b) does not address door operation for the \u201cOFF\u201d position as 2.27.3.4(b), 2.27.3.4(c), and 2.27.3.4(d) do for the \u201cHOLD\u201d and \u201cON\u201d positions. Neither does 2.27.3.4(b) distinguish between horizontal and vertical sliding power-operated door(s) for the \u201cOFF\u201d position as 2.27.3.3.3 does. Question (1): Should 2.27.3.3 (second paragraph) also include 2.27.3.3.3 as a third exception? Answer (1): No. When the key is moved to \u201cOFF,\u201d the mode changes to \u201cOFF\u201d and the doors start to close. While in \u201cOFF\u201d mode, if the key is moved to \u201cON\u201d or \u201cHOLD,\u201d the \u201cOFF\u201d mode determines that the doors reopen. Once they reach fully open, the mode changes to \u201cON\u201d or \u201cHOLD.\u201d Question (2): Is it correct that the Phase II Fire Service mode established after restoration of power under 2.27.3.4 (a)  is based solely on the position of the \u201cFIRE OPERATION\u201d switch; (b)  is without regards to the normally open door position [2.27.3.3 (second paragraph)]; and (c)  is without regards to any door position, open or closed or ajar (not fully open or closed)? Answer (2): (a)  Yes. (b)  Yes. (c)  Yes. Question (3): If the answers to Questions (2)(a), (b), and (c) are yes, then, is it also correct that any subsequent door operation would be based on the Phase II Fire Service mode that was established due to the \u201cFIRE OPERATION\u201d switch position at the time power was restored and not at the time power was lost? Answer (3): Yes. 30 Copyright        2013 by the American Society of Mechanical Engineers.

(a)  \u201cON\u201d \u2014 Remain ajar. Requirement 2.27.3.4(d) does not permit the power-operated door(s) to move until a \u201cDOOR OPEN\u201d or \u201cDOOR CLOSE\u201d button is pressed. (b)  \u201cHOLD\u201d \u2014 Open automatically. Requirement 2.27.3.4(c) requires the power-operated door(s) to open if not fully closed. (c)  \u201cOFF\u201d \u2014 The horizontal sliding power-operated door(s) should close automatically. Requirement 2.27.3.3.3(a) requires that the horizontal sliding power-operated door(s) close auto- matically when the switch is in the \u201cOFF\u201d position. Answer (4): (a)  Yes. (b)  Yes. (c)  Yes. Question (5): If the vertical sliding power-operated door(s) is ajar (not fully open or closed) and the car is in the leveling zone, at the time power is restored under 2.27.3.4 and based on the position of the \u201cFIRE OPERATION\u201d switch, is the following the correct operation for the vertical sliding power-operated door(s)? (a)  \u201cON\u201d \u2014 Remain ajar. Requirement 2.27.3.4(d) does not permit the power-operated door(s) to move until a \u201cDOOR OPEN\u201d or \u201cDOOR CLOSE\u201d button is pressed. (b)  \u201cHOLD\u201d \u2014 Open automatically. Requirement 2.27.3.4(c) requires the power-operated door(s) to open if not fully closed. (c)  \u201cOFF\u201d \u2014 The vertical sliding power-operated door(s) should not move until commanded to do so in accordance with 2.27.3.3.1(e). Answer (5): (a)  Yes. (b)  Yes. (c)  Yes.

(b)  If the answer to Question (6)(a) is yes, does the door(s) reopen in response to the release of the \u201cDOOR CLOSE\u201d button? (c)  If the answer to Question (6)(a) is yes, does the door(s) reopen in response to the \u201cFIRE OPERATION\u201d switch being moved to the \u201cHOLD\u201d position? (d)  When does the Phase II Fire Service mode change from \u201cON\u201d to \u201cHOLD\u201d take place in this scenario? Answer (6): (a)  Yes, see 2.27.3.3.1(e). (b)  Yes. (c)  No. See answer to Question (6)(a). (d)  The mode changes when the doors reach the normal open position (see 2.27.3.3). 31 Copyright        2013 by the American Society of Mechanical Engineers.

I agree that a hoistway access switch should only bypass the hoistway door interlock or electric contact with which it is associated (e.g., a hoistway access switch located on the front landing side should only bypass the hoistway door interlock or electric contact at the front landing side at that floor, and not the rear landing side). But the other part of the question, which seems to have been overlooked in the response, had to do with bypassing the car door or gate electric contact at a different entrance (i.e., front, rear, or side) than the side where the access switch is located. I don\u2019t see anything that addresses this at all in 2.12.7.3, nor do I see the safety hazard as long as the hoistway door on that side is closed and locked, as it is required to be in order to move the car on hoistway access operation. Question: If a hoistway access switch located on the front landing side of the hoistway is actuated, is it permissible for it to bypass the car door or gate electric contact on the rear side, assuming that 2.12.7.3.1 through 2.12.7.3.8 are complied with?

Requirement 2.27.3.3.4 refers to the recall level which can be either the designated level or the alternate level. There is no reference in 2.27.3.2.4(c) to substitute alternate level for designated level in 2.27.3.3.5. When the Phase II \u201cFIRE OPERATION\u201d switch is turned to the \u201cOFF\u201d position the elevator will recall to the appropriate recall level; however, if this was the alternate level, the elevator must then be moved to the designated level in order to be removed from Phase II Emergency In-Car Operation. Elevators can be removed from Phase I Emergency Recall if at the alternate level as permitted by 2.27.3.2.4 and 2.27.3.1.6(k). Question (1): Must an elevator on Phase II Emergency In-Car Operation be moved to the designated level in order to remove it from Phase II Emergency In-Car Operation? Answer (1): Yes. Question (2): When the recall level is the alternate level and the Phase II Fire Operation Switch is turned to the \u201cOFF\u201d position, must an elevator (a)  at the designated level with doors open, and Phase I still active, return immediately to the alternate level? (b)  at the designated level, with doors open, and Phase I has been reset, return immediately to the alternate level? (c)  at the designated level with doors closed, return immediately to the alternate level, indepen- dent of the Phase I status? (d)  at a level other than the designated or alternate level, return immediately to the alternate level, independent of the Phase I status? Answer (2): (a)  Yes. The elevator is removed from Phase II Operation at the designated level. Since Phase I Operation is still active, the elevator then proceeds to the alternate level on Phase I Operation. (b)  No. Since Phase I Operation has been reset, the elevator is removed from Firefighter\u2019s Emergency Operation. (c)  Yes; the elevator returns to the alternate level regardless of the Phase I condition but remains on Phase II Emergency In-Car Operation. (d)  Yes; the elevator returns to the alternate level regardless of the Phase I condition but remains on Phase II Emergency In-Car Operation. Question (3): When an elevator at the designated level is removed from Phase II Emergency In-Car Operation, is it also removed from Firefighter\u2019s Emergency Operation, if other elevators controlled by the same Phase I key switch(es) have previously been removed from Phase I Emergency Recall?

All call-registered lights and directional lanterns shall be extinguished and remain inoperative. Car position indicators, where provided, shall remain operative. Where provided, landing position indicators shall be extinguished and remain inoperative, except at the designated level and the building fire control station, where they shall remain operative. The following is the current Code requirement that covers the reinstatement to normal operation from Phase II: Elevators shall be removed from Phase II Emergency In-Car Operation only when the \u201cFIRE OPERATION\u201d switch is in the \u201cOFF\u201d position and the car is at the designated level and the doors are in the normal open position. Typically, fire services and emergency medical response teams utilize Phase II Operation for medical calls by taking one car of a group of elevators. The process used to achieve this is to activate Phase I and then select the desired car by initiating Phase II, then subsequently resetting the \u201cFIRE RECALL\u201d switch so that all remaining cars are returned to normal operation. Question: Is it the intent to reinstate corridor call buttons once the \u201cFIRE RECALL\u201d switch has been turned to the \u201cRESET\u201d position and then to \u201cOFF,\u201d even though one elevator is still on Phase II Operation? Answer: Yes. See revised text in 2.27.3.1.6(k) and 2.27.3.3.1(b)(4) in ASME A17.1b\u20132009.

Devices shall be provided that will cause the opening of the power circuit to the escalator driving-machine motor and brake if either (a)  a horizontal force not greater than 1 780 N (400 lbf) in the direction of travel is applied at either side, or not greater than 3 560 N (800 lbf) at the center of the front edge of the comb-plate; or (b)  a resultant vertical force not greater than 670 N (150 lbf) in the upward direction is applied at the center of the front of the combplate. These devices shall be of the manual-reset type.\u201d Question (1): Does a single device that will \u201ccause the opening of the power circuit to the escalator driving-machine motor and brake\u201d when either the horizontal forces in (a) or the vertical forces in (b) are applied (used in multiple locations, such as left, right, top, and bottom, as necessary), comply with the requirements of this rule? Answer (1): Yes. Question (2): Does a single device comprised of a single switch that will \u201ccause the opening of the power circuit to the escalator driving-machine motor and brake\u201d when either the horizontal forces in (a) or the vertical forces in (b) are applied (used in multiple locations, such as left, right, top, and bottom, as necessary), comply with the requirements of this rule? Answer (2): Yes. Question (3): Does the plural form of the \u201cDevices\u201d term in the requirement require that two individual devices be supplied, one for horizontal forces applied and one for vertical forces applied? Answer (3): No. Question (4): Does a device that activates with a horizontal force, in the direction of travel, with any magnitude from 1 lbf through 400 lbf, comply with the requirements of 6.1.6.3.13(a)?

The guard shall be made of material that will reject a 13 mm (0.5 in.) diameter ball and shall extend the full width of the step treads. A guard is not required where the only equipment normally serviced from within the enclosure is within the step band.\u201d Question (1): A search of ASME A17.1 indicates that the term \u201cstep band\u201d is not used anywhere other than 6.1.7.3.4. Can the Committee define what is meant by the step band in the context of this requirement? Answer (1): Yes. The \u201cstep band\u201d is a term of art used in the escalator industry to refer to the steps and their interconnecting means as a continuous entity. Question (2): Does the phrase \u201cWhere access is provided\u201d mean any and all access? Answer (2): No. Question (3): If the answer to Question (2) is no, in the interest of providing clarification, would it be better to say \u201cWhere full body access is provided\u201d if that is what the Committee intends? Answer (3): No. Question (4): It is permitted to make the aforementioned guard capable of being removed? Answer (4): Yes. Question (5): If the answer to Question (4) is yes, would the removal of the guard require that the unit not be capable of being operated in either direction unless on inspection control? (See 6.1.6.2.2.) Answer (5): The Code does not address this issue. Question (6): Would a guard made of a material other than metal meet the requirement? Answer (6): Yes. Question (7): Would a guard capable of being deflected sufficiently to cause it (the guard) to come into contact with the moving steps meet the requirement? Answer (7): The Code does not address this issue. A17 Standards Committee Approval: January 26, 2011 51 Copyright        2013 by the American Society of Mechanical Engineers.

I have several questions based on various portions of 2.14.7 that I would like to have answered. These questions are as follows. Question (1): Are switches (dimmer switches) that allow the level of illumination inside an elevator car to be adjusted prohibited? If the answer to this question is yes, then please disregard the remaining questions. Answer (1): No. Question (2): Does 2.14.7.2.1 require these dimmer switches to be located in or adjacent to the car operating devices? Answer (2): The switch must be located in or adjacent to the operating device in the car. The location of the dimmer is not addressed by the ASME A17.1/CSA B44 Code. Question (3): If the answer to Question (2) is no, would these dimmer switches be permitted to be located (a)  on the car top? (b)  inside the car? (c)  inside the machine room/space or control room/space? (d)  anywhere someone wants as long as compliance with 2.14.7.1.2 is provided for the specific type of elevator? Answer (3): See response to Question (2). Question (4): Does 2.14.7 require these dimmer switches to be configured such that the level of illumination could not be adjusted below the minimum level required of the specific type of elevator? Answer (4): The configuration requirements of a dimmer switch are not addressed by the ASME A17.1/CSA B44 Code. However, if you reduce the level of illumination below that required by 2.14.7.1.2, it is not in compliance with the Code, except as permitted by 2.14.7.2.2.

(I believe that this is in response to new requirements in the 2010 NFPA 72, National Fire Alarm Code.) In some cases this is providing an additional signal to activate Phase I recall. In other cases this is being used to flash the fire hat indicator in response to activation of the shunt trip heat detector or flow switch. Because the power is immediately disconnected upon activation, the elevator cannot recall under Phase I. However, in the event of damage to a sprinkler head causing flow switch activation, a simultane- ous shunt trip and Phase I recall will be initiated and a fire threat in the machine room will be indicated where no such threat actually exists. My understanding is that these are two entirely separate emergency operation functions with very specific safety purposes. I do not believe that this is the intent of the firefighters\u2019 service requirements of the Code to overlap or combine these two functions and this implementation is in error. I believe the flashing fire hat indicator should never be used as a flow switch or heat detector indicator for shunt trip devices. Question (1): Are shunt trip activation devices allowed to initiate Phase I recall? Answer (1): Permitted fire alarm initiating devices are defined by NFPA 72 or NBCC. See 2.27.3.2.1, 2.27.3.2.2, and 2.27.4.2 of ASME A17.1-2010/CSA B44-10. Question (2): Are shunt trip activation devices allowed to use the Phase I fire hat indicator to indicate activation?

The elevator area was recently modified to enclose all of the elevator entrance areas in a lobby. These lobbies are not heated or cooled in any way, but are partitioned off from direct exposure to the outside weather. These lobbies are not provided with any smoke, heat, or fire detectors under the direction of our fire protection engineers. As a result there is no way to activate Firefighters\u2019 Service except with the key switch at the designated landing, or with the machine room smoke detector, and since there is no way to differentiate the designated and alternate landings or otherwise identify any fire floor, there really is no alternate landing, and an elevator could easily be directed to a landing where there may be a fire. Question (1): Is it allowable to provide no lobby fire alarm initiating devices for the activation of Phase I Firefighters\u2019 Service under the elevator Code? Answer (1): No. Question (2): Is it allowable to provide no effective alternate landing under the elevator Code?

The only flow switch device currently on the market is for a piping size too small to be used in the sprinkler supply piping for typical sprinkler systems in machine rooms. Instead, they are specifically substituting flow switches with time delay capability, with the timer set to zero. They are posting a sign requiring that the timers not be reset. The installation of flow switches with time delay capability for shunt trip initiation is specifically prohibited by the requirements of NFPA 72. Question (1): Is the use of a flow switch with time delay capability, and with the timer set to zero, allowable under the elevator Code? Answer (1): This issue is not addressed by ASME A17.1/CSA B44. See NFPA 72. Question (2): Does the addition of a sign, indicating that no one should tamper with the timer, sufficient to make this device allowable under the elevator Code?

The signal shall remain activated until the car has returned to the designated level.\u201d We have had issues with some equipment that is alleged to comply with the above-referenced standards creating confusion among firefighters. Firefighters in this state have been trained by their departments to look for a flashing fire hat in the car as an indication that shunt trip operation may be about to take place. Some equipment that is alleged to comply with the above-referenced Code (fortunately very few) flash the in-car visual signal whenever Phase I recall is initiated. We believe this to be wrong and only adds confusion for a firefighter already in a stressful situation, especially in light of the subsequent Code editions that specify when the Phase I visual signal is required to be illuminated intermittently. The flashing or intermittent illumination of the Phase I signal in the car could cause firefighters to mistakenly abandon such a car in the false assumption that shunt trip operation is imminent. Therefore, we ask this question. Question: Is the Phase I visual signal permitted to illuminate intermittently when Phase I recall is in effect? Answer: No. A17 Standards Committee Approval: September 21, 2011 Inquiry: 11-975 Subject: Requirement 2.13.4.2.3 Edition: ASME A17.1\u20132000/CSA B44-00 through ASME A17.1\u20132010/CSA B44-10 Question: Does the door force requirement (135 N or 30 lbf) apply to center opening doors when measured (a)  between the opposing doors; (b)  between each door and a stationary object?
